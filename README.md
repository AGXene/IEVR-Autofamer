## $$\color{blue}⚽Welcome !!!$$

 
Welcome to IEVR Autofarmer !!! Thanks to this tool, you can solve the problem of having to manually farm spirits, beans, or other items in each match, **allowing you to do it automatically without needing to be attentive to the computer or controller**, using a screen color detection system that knows when the game ends and starts.

### ❓❓ <ins> **What is the difference compared to using a macro?** </ins> ❓❓

A macro will never know when a game has finished, wasting time and reducing efficiency. This problem is solved by IEVR Autofarmer app, which uses a screen color detection system to determine when a game is over. This way, twice as many games can be run in the same amount of time compared to using a macro.

``` Example: 1 hour using a macro = 8 matches / 1 hour using Autofarmer = 11 - 20 matches ```
