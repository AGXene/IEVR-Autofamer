## $$\color{blue}⚽Welcome !!!$$

 
Welcome to IEVR Autofarmer !!! Thanks to this tool, you can solve the problem of having to manually farm spirits, beans, or other items in each match, **allowing you to do it automatically without needing to be attentive to the computer or controller**, using a screen color detection system that knows when the game ends and starts.

### <ins>**Features**</ins>
- Detects when a match has ended.
- Can configure some parameters of the autofarmer (audio, number of matches, target screen...).
- An audio system that plays a sound when a match is over or when the process is finished, that can be deactivated.
- Can select the number of matches to execute.

### ❓❓ <ins> **What is the difference compared to using a macro?** </ins> ❓❓

A macro will never know when a game has finished, wasting time and reducing efficiency. This problem is solved by IEVR Autofarmer app, which uses a screen color detection system to determine when a game is over. This way, twice as many games can be run in the same amount of time compared to using a macro.

``` Example: 1 hour using a macro = 8 matches / 1 hour using Autofarmer = 11 - 20 matches ```

To continue updating the tool and streamlining the process, it would be a great help if you could help me with donations. The more support I receive, the sooner I will finish implementing all the features. After all, this is a project just for the fun of it, to help the Inazuma Eleven Victory Road community.
