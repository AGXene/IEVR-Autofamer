4. Check if it's working correctly. If you haven't selected Heroic difficulty and the match hasn't started, stop the execution and start again. If it's working correctly, don't move the mouse or switch applications to avoid any error.
5. Enjoy it!!!

> [!NOTE]
> If you wish to reopen the Autofarmer application window to view real-time results or use your computer, there is a 5- to 25-minute interval during the first half when the Autoclicker does not send any type of input into the system. Use this time to take care of other tasks.
